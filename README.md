# packaged SCSS style guide

A package containing essential css classes in the SCSS format. Use this package to eliminate the effort of creating the very basic reusable classes such as padding, border, font styles, etc when you start the initial scalfoldding of your project.

Zero effort for typical css features such as making a <div> displayed as inline for alignment purpose and special effect such as creating a <div> filled with a linear gradient.

It's pure SCSS so you could add it on top of your SCSS framework such as Bootstrap with less concern of conflicts.
